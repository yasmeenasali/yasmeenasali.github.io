<h1 id="about">About Me</h1>

<!--author-->

I work with [Professor Marla Geha](http://www.astro.yale.edu/mgeha/) on characterizing star formation in satellite galaxies around Milky Way analogs. 
I graduated from Columbia University in 2020 with a BA in Astrophysics and Departmental Honors in Physics. As an undergraduate, I was a member of the LIGO Collaboration and I worked with [Professor Szabi Marka](https://www.physics.columbia.edu/content/szabolcs-marka) and [Dr. Zsuzsa Marka](http://www.zsuzsamarka.org/index.html). I contributed to the [LLAMA pipeline](https://multimessenger.science/) to search for gravitational wave and high energy neutrino coincidences, and I worked on both the software and hardware of the LIGO timing diagnostic system. As part of the University of Florida International REU program, I worked with [Professor Chris Van Den Broeck](https://www.nikhef.nl/~vdbroeck/) at Nikhef in the testing GR subgroup of the LIGO - Virgo Collaboration. I was also a participant in the Columbia Astronomy research exchange program with Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, where I spent a summer working on dark matter annihilation using simulated CTA data with [Dr. German Gomez-Vargas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/german-gomez-vargas-80a020a2/?originalSubdomain=cl).

I care deeply about mentoring, pedagogy, and public education, and I devote time to building community in a variety of ways. I serve as an elected representative on the [Astronomy Student Council at Yale](https://astronomy.yale.edu/about/astronomy-student-council), and am a member of the [Astronomy Climate and Diversity Committee](https://astronomy.yale.edu/about/climate-and-diversity). I am also a [McDougal Graduate Teaching Fellow](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/people/yasmeen-asali) at the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning and a Graduate Affiliate at Ezra Stiles College. Outside of astronomy, I love to care for my constantly growing collection of plants. I enjoy visiting museums and learning about art history, and I love to travel. I am also a big fan of sudoku and sudoku variants, and I often (try to) solve the puzzles from the [Cracking the Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-UOdK8-mIjxBQm_ot1T-Q) youtube channel.

I was interviewed by the Blue and White maganzine in early 2020. You can [check it out here](https://www.theblueandwhite.org/post/yasmeen-asali) to read more about me!

I work with the SAGA Survey, a spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey aiming to characterize satellites around 100 Milky Way (MW) analog systems. As an undergraduate, I was a member of the LIGO Collaboration. You can find summaries of my work on [this page](/pages/undergrad-research).

<h2>The Size-Mass Relation for Low-Mass Galaxies across Environments</h2> 
Understanding how environment shapes the evolution of low-mass galaxies is key to linking internal and external drivers of galaxy growth. Using the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, I recently established new constraints on the size-mass relation for low-mass galaxies across satellite and isolated environments. I compared the structural properties of satellite galaxies around MW-analogs with two control samples: an environmentally agnostic population from the SAGA background (SAGAbg) sample and isolated galaxies from the SDSS NASA-Sloan Atlas. We find the half-light sizes of SAGA satellites are systematically larger than those of isolated galaxies, with the magnitude of the offset ranging from 0.05 to 0.12 dex (10-24%) depending on the comparison sample and completeness cuts. This offset persists among star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environment can influence the structure of low-mass galaxies even before it impacts quenching. The intrinsic scatter in the size-mass relation is lower for SAGA satellites than isolated galaxies, and the Sérsic index distributions of satellites and isolated galaxies are similar. In comparison to star-forming satellites, quenched SAGA satellites have a slightly shallower size-mass relation and rounder morphologies at low-mass, suggesting that quenching is accompanied by structural transformation and that the processes responsible differ between low- and high-mass satellites. Our results show that environmental processes can imprint measurable structural differences on satellites in Milky Way-mass halos.

<h2>Neutral Gas Depletion in Satellites</h2> 
I am leading a neutral hydrogen (HI) follow-up campaign of 81 SAGA systems with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to quantify the neutral gas content in satellites. Our preliminary results suggest that the satellite population is gas-depleted relative to isolated galaxies, aligned with expectations from the literature that environmental processes lead to population level depletion.
